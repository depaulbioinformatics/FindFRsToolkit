# Find FRs Toolkit
---

## **Note: This repo is documentation for find-frs-toolkit, the source code can be seen at https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit**

## Description

Find FRs Toolkit is a combination of programs used to analyze .bed files. All of the programs output to a .csv file format. You must have golang installed to run .exe/.linux64 programs, and you must have java in order to run .jar files. 

## Usage

1. Download/clone repository
2. Navigate to the \out\ directory
3. Execute ```$ java -jar <desired .jar file>``` or ```$ ./<desired .exe/.linux64 file>```
4. Follow the prompts

## Sample Data

The sample outputs are linked in each of the respective title for each program description.

### [findfrs.combinations.regions.count.jar (link to output)](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.combinations.regions.count.csv)
> This program counts the different prefixes found in names of genomes in different genome regions
> There can be multiple prefixes to search for each group, and any prefixes that haven't been specified will be put in an "other" group.

Example usage: 
```
$ java -jar findfrs.combinations.regions.count.jar
Please input the bed file directory:
..\sample\data\sampleData.bed
Please input the output desired .csv file directory:
..\sample\output\findfrs.combinations.regions.count.csv
How many groups are you looking for? (Not including the "Other" group)
1
Please input the prefix of group 1 (case sensitive seperated by semicolons):
medtr
Wrote to CSV: ..\sample\output\findfrs.combinations.regions.count.csv
```

### [findfrs.combinations.regions.presence.jar (link to output)](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.combinations.regions.presence.csv)
> Similar to findfrs.combinations.regions.count.jar, this looks for the different prefixes in different genome regions.
> Instead of counting the groupings, this simply identifies the presence of a prefix within a given location, using a 1 or a 0, 1 being present and 0 being absent.

Example usage: 
```
$ java -jar findfrs.combinations.regions.presence.jar
Please input the bed file directory:
..\sample\data\sampleData.bed
Please input the output desired .csv file directory:
..\sample\output\findfrs.combinations.presence.count.csv
How many groups are you looking for? (Not including the "Other" group)
1
Please input the prefix of group 1 (case sensitive seperated by semicolons):
medtr

### [findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.count.jar (link to output)](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.count.csv) & [findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.presence.jar link to output)](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.presence.csv)
> These two are similar their counterparts with just region in its name, except it looks for prefixes in each region and subregion (i.e fr0:1, fr0:2)

Example usage:
```
$ java -jar findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.count.jar
Please input the bed file directory:
..\sample\data\sampleData.bed
Please input the output desired .csv file directory:
..\sample\output\findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.count.csv
How many groups are you looking for? (Not including the "Other" group)
1
Please input the prefix of group 1 (case sensitive seperated by semicolons):
medtr
Wrote to CSV: ..\sample\output\findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.count.csv
Time elapsed: 558ms
```

```
$ java -jar findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.presence.jar
Please input the bed file directory:
..\sample\data\sampleData.bed
Please input the output desired .csv file directory:
..\sample\output\findfrs.combinations.regionvariants.presence.csv
How many groups are you looking for? (Not including the "Other" group)
1
Please input the prefix of group 1 (case sensitive seperated by semicolons):

### [findfrs.patterns.jar (link to output)](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.patterns.csv)
> This program searches for any genomes across regions that contain duplicate names AND duplicate start locations AND duplicate end locations.

Example usage
```
$ java -jar findfrs.patterns.jar
Please enter the directory of the BED file
..\sample\data\sampleData.bed
Please enter the desired directory of the output CSV file
..\sample\output\findfrs.patterns.csv

### findfrs.regioncounts.jar [Link to Output 1](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.regioncounts_regionCounts.csv), [Link to Output 2](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.regioncounts_regionVariants.csv), [Link to Output 3](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.regioncounts_regionVariantCounts.csv) 
> This program exports 3 different csv files.
> One csv file reveals the different regions present in the .bed file and their count
> Another csv file reveals the variants (subregions) present in the .bed file
> The last csv file reveals the count of the different variants (subregions) in the .bed file

Example usage: 
```
$ java -jar findfrs.regioncounts.jar
Please enter the directory of the BED file:
..\sample\data\sampleData.bed
Please enter the directory of the CSV file: (Doesn't have to end with .csv)
..\sample\output\findfrs.regioncounts

### [findfrs.ranges.jar & findfrs.ranges.exe (Windows) & findfrs.ranges.linux64 (Linux 64) (link to output)](https://github.com/vfdizon/find-frs-toolkit/blob/master/sample/output/findfrs.ranges.csv)
> This searches the given directory for .gff3 files, which are annotations for a bed file
> This then concatenates the .bed file line and the line in the .gff3 file together in one line of the .csv output, if the start and end location are within any range in the .gff3 file
> The .jar file is written in java, and the .exe/./linux64 executables are written in golang.
> The java version is better suited for smaller datasets, while the golang version is better for larger datasets, and utilizes concurrency to search the .bed file for each .gff3 file. 
> The golang version also writes to the .csv file in batches as the program is running.

Example usage (.jar):
```
$ java -jar findfrs.ranges.jar
Please enter .bed file path:
..\sample\data\sampleData.bed
Please enter the directory of all of the annotations (.gff3) files
..\sample\data
Please enter the output directory for the CSV file
..\sample\output\findfrs.ranges.csv
